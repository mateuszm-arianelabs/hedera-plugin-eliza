# `@elizaos/plugin-hedera`

This plugin provides actions and utilities for interacting with Hedera blockchain.

---

## Development

Prepare Eliza according to [README](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/main/README.md).

Add variables required for `@elizaos/plugin-hedera` :

```env
# accepts ED25519 and ECDSA private keys both DER and HEX encoded
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY= 

# accepts hedera account id ex. `0.0.5393196`
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=

# accepts 'mainnet', 'testnet' or 'previewnet'
HEDERA_NETWORK_TYPE=

# accepts 'ECDSA' or 'ED25519'
HEDERA_KEY_TYPE= 
```

Ensure the appropriate environment variables are added for the plugin. If they are correctly configured, the project will run with `@elizaos/plugin-hedera`

Run Eliza

``` bash
  pnpm run dev
```

---

### Using the universal helper Character

The plugin includes a pre-configured character, `universalHelper.character.json`, optimized for Hedera blockchain operations. This character enhances interaction by:

- Handling repeated prompts effectively.

- Better extracting data from user prompts and matching them with proper actions.

To use the character, pass it with the `--characters` flag:

```bash
  pnpm run dev --characters='../characters/universalHelper.character.json'
```

---

### Testing
For testing purposes it is recommended to erase agent's memory on the app start.
This helps you achieve clean environment and erases impact of previously called actions and passed prompts which helps to test new changes during development.
To erase agent's memory and run Eliza with recommended character use following script
```bash
  rm ./agent/data/db.sqlite ; pnpm run dev --character ./characters/universalHelper.character.json 
```
---

## Provider
Plugin implements provider creating instance of `HederaAgentKit` from 
`hedera-agent-kit`. `HederaAgentKit` offers API for interacting with Hedera blockchain and supports executing of operations called from actions.

Provider contains method `get()` that is called after each input given by user. It takes care of refreshing amount of HBAR held by connected account and stored in agent's memory - state.

Connected wallet is considered to be the agent's property. Due to that fact for extracting knowledge about connected wallet's HBAR balance use the following prompt:
1. User input
```
What's yours HBAR balance?
```
2. Response from LLM based on stored context:
```
My current HBAR balance is 999.81307987 HBAR.
```

Note that there is no action required for getting agent's HBAR balance.

---

## Actions

### HBAR Balance

HBAR balance action allows checking HBAR balance of any given valid Hedera wallet.
Note that this action takes one mandatory parameter:

```

2. LLM response - action execution:

```
I'll help you get the HBAR balance of wallet 0.0.5423981. (HEDERA_HBAR_BALANCE)
```

3. Action's callback response:

```
Address 0.0.5423981 has balance of 120.76334864 HBAR
```
Currently, EVM wallet addresses are **not supported.** Please pass Hedera addresses (ex. `0.0.5423981`).

### Get Topic Messages

The **Get Topic Messages** action allows fetching messages published to a topic either without filtering or within a specified time range.

This action requires **one mandatory parameter** and supports **two optional parameters**:

- **`TopicId`** *(mandatory)* – The ID of the selected topic.
- **`lowerThreshold`** *(optional)* – A timestamp in the format `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.NNNZ"`. If provided, it acts as a **"greater than or equal to"** condition.
- **`upperThreshold`** *(optional)* – A timestamp in the format `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.NNNZ"`. If provided, it acts as a **"less than or equal to"** condition.

The `upperThreshold` and `lowerThreshold` parameters can be provided in natural language. The input will be automatically parsed into the required format by the LLM.

If only partial date information is provided (e.g., just the year and month), the LLM will infer the missing details.

**Examples**

- **User input:** `"2nd March 2024"`
    - **Parsed format:** `"2024-03-02T00:00:00.000Z"`
- **User input:** `"2nd March 2024 13:50"`
    - **Parsed format:** `"2024-03-02T13:50:00.000Z"`

Show messages from topic 0.0.5473710 in range 2022 - 2026.
```

**Note:** sometimes LLMs struggles with proper extracting of data from requests. It might happen if first request with specific data range was passed and then next prompt request for all posts (no data range therefore no params) is issued. 
In this case you might need to be more specific and use prompt `Show messages from topic 0.0.5473710. No time range.` instead of `Show messages from topic 0.0.5473710.`.

## Contribution

The plugin is still in development phase. It heavily depends on `hedera-agent-kit` library that is also in during development.
Consider this code as Proof of Concept that requires further improvements.
Areas of possible improvements:
- adding new actions
- improving reliability of data extraction (templates for each action data extraction are in `./src/templates`)
- unit testing the code

## Running Tests

This project communicates with an **ElizaOS instance** via REST API on the default port **`localhost:3000`**.

- Test cases **send messages to the AI agent**, which triggers relevant actions and returns responses.
- The responses are **parsed**, and important data is extracted.
- Based on this extracted data, tests perform **validations** using the **Hedera Mirror Node API** as the source of truth.

#### Important Information

- **Mirror Node delay:** The Hedera Mirror Node has a slight delay, so additional waiting time is required between performing an action and checking the results.
- **Sequential execution only:**
    - Tests **cannot** run in parallel because requests and responses from the agent **must be processed in chronological order**.
    - Concurrent testing is **disabled**, and additional timeouts are introduced before each test to improve reliability.

#### Environment Setup

The `.env` file should contain the **same wallet information** as the running ElizaOS instance.  
Use the `.env.example` file as a reference.
